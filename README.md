👋 Hi, I'm @Insaneuchiha

👀 I'm interested in gaming, web development, and microcontrollers. I love exploring the intersection of software and hardware, creating interactive web experiences, and diving into immersive gaming worlds.
🌱 I'm currently learning web development and data structures & algorithms (DSA). I'm excited about building responsive, user-friendly websites and optimizing code efficiency through strong algorithmic foundations.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on web development projects, game mods, or innovative microcontroller applications. I'm always eager to combine my diverse interests into unique and exciting projects.
